## 🔍 COMPETITOR TITLE TAG ANALYSIS & METHODOLOGY

**Last Competitive Analysis:** November 10, 2025
**Market Focus:** Oklahoma City window treatments and blinds market

### Why This Matters:
Changing title tags without researching what competitors are actually doing is theoretical guessing. The pages ranking #1-3 for keywords already tell us what Google rewards. We analyze THEM first, then recommend based on proven patterns, not theory.

### The 4 Proven Title Tag Patterns in Oklahoma City Market:

#### Pattern #1: BRAND | PRODUCTS | LOCATION, STATE
**Used by:** Hunter Douglas dealers (strong, established)
**Example:** `Graber Blinds & Shades | Custom Window Treatments | Oklahoma City, OK`
**Why it works:** Clear hierarchy (who, what, where); brand authority first
**Best for:** Established dealer pages where brand carries weight
**Strength:** Trust factor; "authorized dealer" credibility

#### Pattern #2: LOCATION PRODUCT: PRODUCT LIST
**Used by:** Bison Blinds (ranks HIGH without brand in title)
**Example:** `Oklahoma City Blinds & Shades: Cellular, Roller, Motorized`
**Why it works:** Location + product keywords first; NO brand name needed
**Best for:** Independent shops or when building local dominance
**Strength:** Pure location-product relevance; doesn't depend on brand recognition

#### Pattern #3: PRODUCT | BRAND | LOCATION
**Used by:** Oklahoma Window Shades (product pages)
**Example:** `Custom Roller Shades | Graber Products | Oklahoma City`
**Why it works:** Product-first on product-specific queries
**Best for:** Pages targeting specific product category searches
**Strength:** Matches user intent (searching for "roller shades")

#### Pattern #4: LOCATION + PRODUCT | BRAND | CTA (HYBRID)
**Used by:** High performers mixing local + brand trust + action
**Example:** `Custom Blinds Oklahoma City | Motorized Shades | Free Consultation`
**Why it works:** Combines location authority, brand trust, and benefit/CTA
**Best for:** Homepage or main service pages
**Strength:** Addresses multiple intent signals; calls action

### Competitive Intelligence Summary:

| Competitor | Primary Keywords Ranking | Title Pattern Used | Strengths | Years in Business |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------|------------------|
| Bison Blinds | blinds oklahoma city, custom blinds, motorized | Pattern #2 (Location-Product) | Location dominance; no brand dependency | 20+ |
| Oklahoma Window Shades | roller shades, cellular shades, solar shades | Pattern #3 (Product-first) | Product-specific ranking strength | 15+ |
| Hunter Douglas Dealers | Various (brand-heavy) | Pattern #1 (Brand first) | Manufacturer backing; established trust | Varies |

**Key Finding:** Bison Blinds proves Pattern #2 works WITHOUT brand in title—this is crucial since we're new and shouldn't emphasize "1 year in business."

### Market Insights Specific to OKC:
- **80% of page 1 winners** include full "Oklahoma City, OK" or "OKC" in title
- **100% of top rankers** list 3-4 product categories (blinds, shades, shutters, motorized)
- **Bison Blinds ranking success** shows brand name is NOT required if location + products are strong
- **All competitors emphasize:** Free consultation, custom everything, professional installation, motorized options
- **What they DON'T emphasize:** Years in business (only when 20+), warranties, certifications

### MANDATORY PROCESS: Before Any Title Tag Recommendation

**You MUST follow this process every time:**

1. **Research the Keyword**
   - User says: "Should we change the title for 'blinds oklahoma city'?"
   - You respond: "Let me search Google for that keyword first"

2. **Analyze Top 3 Competitors**
   - Search: "blinds oklahoma city" on Google
   - Capture the exact title tags of positions #1, #2, #3
   - Document the pattern each is using
   - Note their call-to-action (if any)

3. **Identify the Pattern**
   - Does it match Pattern #1, #2, #3, or #4?
   - What's the exact formula: [Location] [Product] [Brand] [CTA]?
   - Character count (should be 50-60 for optimal display)

4. **Recommend Based on Proof, Not Theory**
   - "Based on top 3 competitors, Pattern X is working"
   - "Recommend: [Your proposed title]"
   - Explain why it matches what's ranking

5. **Document the Change**
   - Record date of competitive analysis
   - Record the keyword researched
   - Record the pattern identified
   - Track results 2-4 weeks post-implementation

### Title Tag Recommendation Templates by Page Type:

**Homepage (Main Service Page)**
- Formula: `[Location] [Primary Product] | [Brand] | [CTA]`
- Example: `Custom Blinds & Shades Oklahoma City | Motorized Solutions | Free Consultation`
- Research: Search "custom blinds [location]" and "window treatments [location]"

**Product Category Page (Roller Shades, Cellular, etc.)**
- Formula: `[Location] [Product Name] | [Brand/Brands] | [Variant]`
- Example: `Custom Roller Shades Oklahoma City | Graber & Norman | Motorized Available`
- Research: Search "[product] [location]" (e.g., "roller shades oklahoma city")

**Brand Page (Graber, Norman)**
- Formula: `[Brand] [Products] | [Location] | [Benefit]`
- Example: `Graber Custom Blinds & Shades | Oklahoma City Dealer | Professional Installation`
- Research: Search "[brand name] [location]" (e.g., "graber blinds oklahoma city")

**Service/Feature Page (Motorized, Solar, etc.)**
- Formula: `[Location] [Feature] [Product] | [Brand] | [Benefit]`
- Example: `Motorized Window Shades Oklahoma City | Graber UltraLite | Smart Home Ready`
- Research: Search "[feature] [location]" (e.g., "motorized shades oklahoma city")

### What NOT to Do (Einstein Insanity Prevention):

❌ Change titles based on "this sounds better"
❌ Use brand name first if you're competing against local specialists
❌ Emphasize "1 year in business" (competitors with 15-20 years are your benchmark)
❌ Skip the Google search—ALWAYS verify what's actually ranking
❌ Exceed 60 characters without research showing longer titles rank

### Best Practice Workflow:

1. Master Plan says "optimize roller shades page"
2. You search "roller shades oklahoma city" on Google
3. You document top 3 competitor titles
4. You identify the winning pattern
5. You propose title matching that pattern + your competitive angle
6. You implement + document date
7. You check GSC results 2-4 weeks later

## 🎯 KEYWORD STRATEGY: INTENT OVER BRAND (Critical Decision Framework)

**Last Updated:** November 10, 2025
**Decision Context:** Repositioning "Graber UltraLite Lift System" page to problem-solution keywords

### The Core Principle:
**Target PROBLEMS people are SEARCHING FOR, not BRAND NAMES people might not know.**

### Why This Matters:
- People search: "quiet cordless shades" (intent: find quiet option)
- People DON'T search: "graber ultralite" (brand-specific, low volume)
- Google ranks pages by INTENT MATCH, not brand familiarity
- New businesses (<2 years) don't have brand recognition yet—so brand-first keywords are wasted effort

### The Mistake to Avoid (Einstein Insanity):
❌ "Let's put Graber UltraLite in the title and hope brand-conscious people find us"
- Result: 0 clicks in 3 weeks (that's data, not theory)
- Why: People aren't searching for the brand name
- Google impact: High bounce rate → lower ranking

✅ **"Let's target WHAT the product solves: quiet operation + cordless + smooth for families"**
- Result: Intent-matched traffic → better CTR → better ranking
- Why: People ARE searching these problems
- Google impact: Low bounce rate + high conversion potential

### Shades vs. Blinds Terminology (IMPORTANT):
- **SHADES** = quiet, smooth operation (roller, cellular, Roman, solar, motorized)
- **BLINDS** = loud mechanism, clunky slats (wood, faux wood, vertical, aluminum)
- **DO NOT** mix shades/blinds keywords on the same page
- UltraLite is a SHADE FEATURE, not a blind feature
- Future Norman cordless page will also target shade-specific keywords

### How to Evaluate Keywords Before Using Them:

**Step 1: Does the keyword describe a PROBLEM or a BRAND?**
- Problem keyword: "quiet shades oklahoma city" ✅ (person has a problem: noise)
- Brand keyword: "graber ultralite lift system" ❌ (person must know the brand first)

**Step 2: Would someone searching THIS keyword be happy with THIS product?**
- "child safe cordless shades" + UltraLite page = YES ✅ (intent matches perfectly)
- "graber ultralite cordless blinds" + UltraLite page = NO ❌ (blinds aren't quiet, shades are)

**Step 3: Check if keyword is on Master Plan + has data**
- Is it in the 100 keywords? Check context and tier
- Does it have GSC impressions in performance reports? Check search demand
- If NOT on plan: Consider adding it only if you've validated search volume exists

### Keywords ON Master Plan That Match UltraLite Product:
- `child safe window coverings oklahoma city` (Tier 5, line 148) ✅ APPROVED
- `pet friendly blinds edmond` (Tier 5, line 149) ⚠️ FIX: Should be "shades" not "blinds"
- `best window treatments for energy efficiency oklahoma` (Tier 5, line 147) ✅ APPROVED (insulation + quiet operation)

### Keywords MISSING from Master Plan (Need to Add):
- `quiet cordless shades oklahoma city` - High intent, low competition
- `smooth operating window shades oklahoma city` - Describes ease of use
- `cordless shades with lift system oklahoma city` - Feature-specific, mechanical operation
- `quiet shades for families oklahoma city` - Combines safety + quiet benefit

### Decision Made (November 10, 2025):
**Tier 6 "Graber-Specific + Smart Home" will be RENAMED to "CORDLESS/SAFETY FEATURES"**
- Removed brand-only keywords
- Added problem/solution keywords that apply to BOTH Graber AND future Norman pages
- Focus on SAFETY, QUIET, CORDLESS, SMOOTH OPERATION intent
- Removed "graber ultralite cordless blinds edmond" (should be SHADES)
- Kept motorization tier separate (different product category)

### For Future AI Assistants: Keyword Vetting Checklist
Before recommending ANY keyword:
- [ ] Is it on the Master Plan's 100 keywords?
- [ ] Does it describe a PROBLEM people search for?
- [ ] Would our product ACTUALLY solve that problem?
- [ ] Does it match the page content (no mismatches like "blinds" when we offer "shades")?
- [ ] Is it geographically specific (OK/OKC) to match our service area?
- [ ] If new keyword: Have we validated it has search volume? (GSC data, search results, competitor ranking)

2. **Immediately update this table** with: page name, ID, section title, content description, relevant keywords, and any usage notes

## 📚 COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: Why don't we create new pages for all the keywords?**

**Q: Why not optimize the solar shades page further?**
A: It's at position 3.4 (top of page 1). Any changes risk making it worse. PROTECT what's working!

**Q: User says a page hasn't been optimized but the plan says it should be done.**
A: ASK the user for current status. Don't assume. They may have done it, or they may need the exact steps.

**Q: How long should we wait to see results?**
A: 2-3 weeks for Google to re-index. 4-6 weeks for position stabilization. Document change dates!

**Q: What if user wants to do something NOT in the Master Plan?**
A: Read the plan's reasoning first. If their idea is good, acknowledge it but explain the plan's logic. Suggest documenting as "deviation from plan" so we can track results.
