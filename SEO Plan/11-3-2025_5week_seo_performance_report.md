# Shaded In The Sun - 5 Week SEO Performance Report
**Report Period:** October 6 - November 3, 2025  
**Analysis Date:** November 3, 2025  
**Comparing Against:** Master Unified SEO Plan v2.0 FINAL

---

## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Bottom Line:
**You're on track, but progress is slower than the Master Plan predicted.** Here's what's happening:

**✅ WINS:**
- **25 keywords on Page 1** (500% over Master Plan goal of 5!)
- **75 keywords in top 20** (400% over Master Plan goal of 15!)
- Solar shades jumping to position 3.4 (top of page 1)
- Nichols Hills page rock-solid at position 2.9
- Impressions growing (+9.9% from Oct 20 to Nov 3)

**⚠️ CONCERNS:**
- Only 1 click in the past 3 weeks (needs urgent attention)
- Average position drifting worse (29.3 → 31.5)
- High-value keyword "blinds oklahoma city" stuck on page 2
- CTR effectively 0% (can't convert impressions to clicks from page 2-3)
- Page 2 keywords declining (-8 keywords)

**🔍 THE REAL ISSUE:**
You're ranking for LOTS of keywords, but most are on pages 2-3 where nobody clicks. The Master Plan's Week 1 action (changing the blinds page title) hasn't been implemented yet, and that's your biggest missed opportunity.

## 🎯 MASTER PLAN vs. REALITY

### Month 1 Goals (From Master Plan)

| Goal | Target | Current (Nov 3) | Status | Notes |
|------|---------|-----------------|---------|-------|
| **Stabilize volatility** | No dramatic swings | Mixed results | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Solar shades/zebra stable, others volatile |
| **Keywords in top 10** | 5+ | **25** | ✅ **500% OVER!** | Crushing this goal |
| **Keywords in top 20** | 15+ | **75** | ✅ **400% OVER!** | Way ahead |
| **Monthly impressions** | 1,000+ | 669 (weekly) | ✅ LIKELY | On track for ~2,700/month |
| **Protect top rankings** | Zebra #4.88, Nichols #2.8 | Zebra #3.1, Nichols #2.9 | ✅ **PROTECTED** | Both maintained |

### What the Plan Got RIGHT ✅
1. **Keyword prioritization** - Solar shades and zebra shades DID hit/maintain page 1
2. **Protective strategy** - Top keywords didn't drop
3. **Page 1 goal** - Exceeded expectations (25 vs. 5 target)

### What the Plan Didn't Predict ⚠️
1. **"Blinds oklahoma city" explosion** - Hit 72 impressions in week 4 (your biggest opportunity)
2. **Average position drift** - Getting worse (29.3 → 31.5) instead of stabilizing
3. **Page 2 keyword decline** - Losing 8 keywords from page 2 to page 3
4. **Zero clicks** - CTR near 0% because most rankings are page 2-3

---

## 🚨 URGENT PRIORITIES (Do These THIS Week)

### Priority 1: Fix "Blinds Oklahoma City" Page 🔥🔥🔥
**Why it's urgent:**
- 72 impressions in week 4 (your HIGHEST traffic keyword ever!)
- Currently position 15.4 (mid page 2)
- Zero clicks because nobody looks at page 2
- Could generate 20-30 clicks/month if on page 1

**What to do (30 minutes):**
1. Open Types-of-window-blinds.html
2. Change title from: "Types of window blinds - Shaded In The Sun"
3. To: "Custom Blinds Oklahoma City & Edmond | Wood, Faux Wood, Aluminum Blinds"
4. Add "Oklahoma City" naturally 6-8 times in first 200 words
5. Add H2: "Custom Window Blinds for Oklahoma City Homes"

**Expected impact:** Position 15.4 → 8-10 within 2 weeks (page 1!)

---

### Priority 2: Optimize Roller Shades Page
**Why it's urgent:**
- Position 10.1 (JUST missed page 1 by 0.1!)
- Impressions growing (+50% over 3 weeks)
- One small push gets this to page 1

**What to do (20 minutes):**
1. Open window-shades.html
2. Add H3 section: "Roller Shades for Oklahoma City Homes"
3. Add 100-150 words about roller shades in Oklahoma
4. Include "roller shades oklahoma city" 2-3 times naturally

**Expected impact:** Position 10.1 → 6-8 within 1 week (solid page 1!)

---

### Priority 3: Protect What's Working ✅
**DO NOT TOUCH these pages:**
- Solar shades content (position 3.4 - perfect!)
- Zebra shades content (position 3.1 - perfect!)
- Nichols Hills page (position 2.9 - perfect!)

These are working perfectly. Any changes could hurt rankings.

## 📉 WHY AVERAGE POSITION IS GETTING WORSE

**The paradox:** You have MORE page 1 keywords, but WORSE average position. Here's why:

1. **You're ranking for more long-tail keywords**
   - Oct 20: 143 unique queries
   - Nov 3: 149 unique queries (+6)
   - New keywords start on page 3-5 (positions 30-50)
   - This drags down your average

2. **Page 2 keywords are slipping to page 3**
   - Lost 8 keywords from page 2
   - These fell to page 3+ (positions 21-30)
   - This hurts average more than page 1 gains help

3. **Not enough page 1 momentum**
   - Only gained 1 page 1 keyword in 3 weeks
   - Need to push more page 2 keywords (positions 11-15) to page 1
   - That's where clicks happen

**This is actually NORMAL** when:
- You're a new site (3 months old)
- You're getting discovered for new keywords
- You haven't optimized pages yet (like blinds page title)

**How to fix it:**
- Focus on improving page 2 keywords (positions 11-20)
- These are "low-hanging fruit" - closest to page 1
- Blinds page title change should move 2-3 keywords up
- Roller shades optimization should push it over the edge

---

## 🔍 INSIGHTS & ANALYSIS

### What's Working ✅

1. **Local neighborhood pages** are crushing it
   - Nichols Hills page: Position 2.9 (page 1)
   - This proves the local strategy works
   - Need to create more: Edmond, Piedmont, Moore

2. **Product-specific keywords** with great content work
   - Solar shades: Position 3.4 (top of page 1)
   - Zebra shades: Position 3.1 (top of page 1)
   - These pages have quality content already

3. **Brand association** is happening
   - "graber shutters plantation": 21 impressions
   - People searching for Graber are finding you
   - Norman page (just created) will help when it matures

### What's NOT Working ❌

1. **Generic service pages** without location keywords
   - "blinds oklahoma city" stuck on page 2
   - Page has wrong title ("Types of window blinds")
   - Not enough "Oklahoma City" mentions

2. **Motorization keywords** not ranking
   - "motorized window treatments oklahoma city" - no impressions
   - "automated blinds oklahoma city" - no impressions
   - Motorized page needs location optimization

3. **CTR is near zero**
   - 0.15% CTR is terrible (industry average: 2-5%)
   - Why? Because you're on page 2-3 for most keywords
   - Page 1 positions 1-3 get 75% of all clicks
   - Page 2 gets <2% of clicks

### The One-Click Analysis 🔍

In 3 weeks, you got exactly 1 click. Let's see what worked:

**Week 3 (Oct 20):** 1 click
- Keyword: "window treatment oklahoma city"
- Position: 12.2 (page 2)
- This proves: Even page 2 can get clicks if the searcher is motivated enough

**Week 5 (Nov 3):** 1 click
- Keyword: "sun shade company"
- Position: 2.29 (page 1)
- This proves: Page 1 positions 2-3 get clicks consistently

**Takeaway:** You need MORE keywords at positions 2-3, not just on page 1 somewhere. That's why solar shades (3.4) and zebra shades (3.1) are perfect - they're in the "click zone."

---

## 🎓 KEY LEARNINGS

### 1. The Title Tag is EVERYTHING
Your biggest keyword has the wrong title. "Types of window blinds" doesn't include "Oklahoma City" so Google doesn't know to rank you for "blinds oklahoma city." This one fix could be a game-changer.

### 2. Page 1 Positions 1-5 Get 75% of All Clicks
Having 25 keywords on page 1 is great, but if they're at positions 8-10, you won't get many clicks. You need to be in positions 2-5 (where solar shades and zebra shades are) to actually get traffic.

### 3. Location Keywords are Non-Negotiable
Every page needs "Oklahoma City" or "Edmond" 6-8 times. You can't rank for local keywords without location words in your content. This is why solar shades (has "okc" in content) ranks but "solar shades oklahoma city" (full phrase) doesn't.

### 4. What's Working Should NEVER Be Touched
Solar shades jumped to position 3.4. Zebra shades at 3.1. Nichols Hills at 2.9. These pages are PERFECT - don't optimize them, don't update them, don't touch them until they slip.

### 5. New Keywords Start on Page 5, That's OK
Your average position looks worse because you're ranking for more keywords, and new keywords start low. This is normal and expected. Focus on pushing page 2 keywords to page 1, not worrying about page 5 keywords.

---

## 🎯 COMPARING TO MASTER PLAN TIMELINE

### Master Plan Said:
**Weeks 1-2: Foundation fixes, immediate stabilization**

### What Actually Happened:
✅ Some stabilization (zebra shades, nichols hills, solar shades)
❌ Average position got worse (not better)
❌ Page 2 keywords declined
⚠️ **Week 1 Priority #1 (blinds title change) was NOT done yet**

### Why the Gap?
The Master Plan's Week 1 urgent task (changing the blinds page title) hasn't been implemented. That single task was predicted to be your biggest win - and your data confirms it! "Blinds oklahoma city" hit 72 impressions in week 4, proving there's HUGE demand. You just need to optimize for it.

### Revised Timeline:
- **This week:** Implement Week 1 priorities (blinds title, roller shades, motorized)
- **Week 2 (Nov 11-17):** Should see blinds keyword move to page 1
- **Week 3 (Nov 18-24):** Monitor and protect gains
- **Week 4 (Nov 25-Dec 1):** Continue with Master Plan Month 2 tasks

**Bottom line:** You're 1 week behind schedule, but that's because the highest-priority task wasn't done yet. Do it this week and you'll catch up fast.

   - Changing titles is easy
   - Adding content sections is straightforward
   - I can provide exact wording if helpful

## 🎬 CONCLUSION

**The Good News:**
You're on the right track. You have way more page 1 keywords than the Master Plan predicted. Your top keywords (solar shades, zebra shades, Nichols Hills) are rock solid. Your impressions are growing. People are discovering you.

**The Bad News:**
Most keywords are on pages 2-3 where nobody clicks. That's why you only got 1 click in 3 weeks. You need to push page 2 keywords to page 1, and the easiest way to do that is the Master Plan Week 1 Priority #1: change the blinds page title.

**The Reality:**
You're 1 week behind schedule because the highest-impact task wasn't done yet. But that's OK! Do it this week and you'll catch up fast. Your fundamentals are strong - you just need to optimize what's already working.

**The Path Forward:**
1. Do the blinds title change this week (30 minutes)
2. Push roller shades to page 1 (20 minutes)
3. Optimize motorized page (1 hour)
4. Wait 1-2 weeks and watch rankings climb
5. Document the wins and keep following the Master Plan

**You've got this! The data shows you're building momentum. Now it's time to convert that momentum into clicks and calls.**
