## 1. MANDATORY PROCESS - RESEARCH FIRST

**Before making ANY recommendations or changes:**
- Conduct competitive research on actual top-ranking competitors (not theory)
- Analyze 5+ competitor pages for the target keywords
- Document their title tags, meta descriptions, content strategies
- Identify patterns in what's ranking
- Only THEN propose changes based on real competitive data

**Never assume.** Always ask before making changes you're unsure about.

## 2. PAGE REVIEW CHECKLIST - "WHAT YOU'LL LEARN" SECTION

**For EVERY page being reviewed or modified:**

1. **Check for "What You'll Learn in This Article" section:**
   - If MISSING: Add it with 3-4 bullet points promising specific content and what the reader will learn
   - If EXISTS: Review and verify each promise is fulfilled in the content below

2. **Evaluate Content Delivery:**
   - Does each bullet point promise something specific?
   - Is that specific topic answered in the content?
   - Could the content answer it better/more thoroughly?
   - Are promises vague or specific?

3. **Format:**
   - H2 title: "What You'll Learn in This Article:"
   - Use checkmark bullets (✓)
   - 3-4 promises max
   - Be specific about what readers will learn

## 3. KEYWORD STRATEGY

### Core Principle
**Target problem-solution keywords (what customers search for), NOT brand names**
- People don't search "Graber blinds" - they search "motorized blinds near me"
- People don't search "Norman shades" - they search "energy efficient window shades"
- Focus on customer pain points and solutions

### 100 Keywords Strategy (7 Tiers)
- Tier 1-7 keywords with search volumes
- Problem-focused: "cordless blinds for safety", "energy saving shades", "motorized window treatments"
- Location-integrated: "motorized blinds Oklahoma City", "custom shades Edmond"
- Natural integration, never forced

### Integration Rules
- **NEVER lowercase city names** - "Oklahoma City" always, never "oklahoma city"
- Use natural prepositions:
  - "motorized blinds for Oklahoma City" ✓
  - "motorized blinds in Oklahoma City" ✓
  - "motorized blinds throughout Oklahoma City" ✓
  - "motorized blinds oklahoma city" ✗ (lowercase, awkward)
- Keywords must fit grammatically in sentences
- Proper capitalization and grammar ALWAYS
- If forcing a keyword makes the sentence awkward, integrate naturally without the keyword
- Example: Instead of forcing "automated blinds oklahoma city" into an awkward sentence, say "automated blinds without leaving the couch" then mention "Oklahoma City" in proper context elsewhere

### CRITICAL: Avoid Keyword Density Overload
- **DO NOT REPEAT CITY NAMES MULTIPLE TIMES IN ONE PARAGRAPH**
- Maximum 2-3 location references per paragraph (not 7+ in one paragraph)
- Spread location keywords throughout the page, not concentrated in one section
- If a paragraph mentions "Oklahoma City" 2x already, don't add "Edmond" just to hit keyword targets
- Focus on natural flow over keyword stuffing
- Example of TOO MUCH: "motorized blinds Oklahoma City homeowners, motorized blinds for Oklahoma City homes, motorized shades Edmond residents, automated blinds Oklahoma City metro" ✗
- Example of GOOD: "motorized blinds for Oklahoma City homeowners bring convenience and control to homes. Whether you're in Edmond or throughout the metro area, we have solutions for you." ✓

## 4. META TAG OPTIMIZATION

### Title Tag
- **Length:** 55-60 characters (optimal) and not longer than 60 as per SEO guidelines
- **Format:** Primary keyword + benefit + location (if relevant)
- **Examples:**
  - "Custom Window Blinds & Shades | Oklahoma City & Edmond"
  - "Quiet Cordless Shades Oklahoma City | Featherlight touch System"
  - "Motorized Window Treatments Oklahoma City - Smart Home Control"

### Meta Description
- **Length:** Maximum 135 characters (verified by SEMRush research to prevent mobile truncation)
- **Why 135?** Ensures full visibility on mobile devices (135.87 chars avg on mobile) and desktop (146.28 chars avg on desktop). Google truncates descriptions that exceed device width.
- **Source:** SEMRush analysis of actual search result display behavior across devices
- **Format:** Benefit-focused, action-oriented, specific
- **Do NOT include dealer names (Graber, Norman, Draper)** - most people don't know these brands
- **DO include:** Phone number for conversion intent (if space allows)
- **Examples (all under 135 chars):**
  - "Custom blinds and shades for every style and budget. Expert installation in Oklahoma City and Edmond. Call 405-259-5599!" (122 chars)
  - "Transform your home with quiet, cordless shades with featherlite touch and safety. Perfect for families. Call today!" (120 chars)

### Brand Strategy in Content
- Use brand mentions naturally in page content when relevant
- NOT in meta descriptions
- Mention authorized dealer status in closing paragraphs
- Focus on benefits, not brand prestige
- **Trademark Symbols:** Use "Norman®" and "Graber®" with actual ® symbol (not HTML entities like &reg;)

---

## 5. LOCATION STRATEGY

### Primary Locations
- Oklahoma City (full name, always)
- Edmond (full name, always)

### Secondary Locations (Footer)
- Nichols Hills, Yukon, The Village, Bethany, Moore, Piedmont, Warr Acres, Mustang
- Metro area references

### Implementation
- Use full location names with proper capitalization
- Vary prepositions for natural reading: "for", "in", "throughout", "serving"
- Location context should fit grammatically
- Avoid forcing locations into unnatural sentence structures

---

## 6. INTERNAL LINKING STRATEGY

### Main Content Section Requirements
- **3-5 internal links per page** (minimum 3, maximum 5)
- First pass: Fix ALL non-descriptive links
- Second pass: Add internal links where missing

### Link Text Rules
- **DESCRIPTIVE:** "Explore our complete shade selection" ✓
- **NOT DESCRIPTIVE:** "click here", "read more", "learn more" ✗
- **NATURAL TO READ:** Links should flow in sentences, not feel forced
- **NOT TOO LONG:** Single phrase, not multiple sentences

### Strategic Linking
- Link to related product pages
- Link to problem-solution content
- Link to pages with more details on topics mentioned
- Don't duplicate links already in the page

### Brand-Specific Link Strategy
- Links mentioning specific brand products should point to brand-specific pages when available
- If no brand-specific page exists, link to benefit/problem-solution page and use descriptive text that clarifies what they'll learn
- Example CORRECT: "Learn more about motorized shades and smart home integration" (link to /motorized-window-treatments-for-OKC.html)
- Example INCORRECT: "Motorized Norman® shades" (link to generic motorized page - doesn't clarify they're learning generic info, not Norman-specific)
- Link text must accurately reflect page content - don't mislead readers about what they'll find

### Link Descriptiveness Requirements
- **ALL links must be descriptive** - applies to main content, Related Articles, footer, everywhere
- Non-descriptive links: "Read More →", "click here", "learn more", "read more", "view more" ✗
- Descriptive links: "Explore motorized shade options", "Discover five reasons to choose custom shades" ✓
- Link text should tell reader what they'll learn or see on destination page
- Links must flow naturally in sentences, not feel forced or generic

### Related Articles Section
- Add if missing
- 3 article cards
- **Important:** Links in Related Articles section should NOT duplicate links already in main content
- Links should NOT all point to same page type
- Vary content: some educational, some product-focused, some benefit-focused
- **All Related Articles links must be descriptive** - not "Read More →"

---

## 7. CONTENT STRUCTURE & FORMATTING

### H1 Tag
- One H1 per page
- Should include primary keyword or main benefit
- Examples:
  - "Custom Window Blinds & Shades for Oklahoma City & Edmond Homes"
  - "Motorized Window Treatments Oklahoma City - Convenience & Control"

### H2 Tags
- Section headers
- Use keywords naturally where appropriate
- Examples: "Key Benefits of Motorized Blinds & Shades in Oklahoma"

### Paragraph Structure
- 2-4 sentences per paragraph
- Clear, benefit-focused messaging
- Integrate keywords naturally, not forced

### Grammar & Capitalization
- Proper capitalization for all proper nouns (Oklahoma City, Edmond, Graber, Norman)
- Correct punctuation
- No run-on sentences
- Keywords integrated as part of natural sentences

---

## 8. COMPETITOR RESEARCH DOCUMENTATION

When researching competitors:
- Document competitor URLs
- Note their title tags
- Note their meta descriptions
- Identify keyword focus
- Note content structure
- Record any unique approaches
- Create brief findings summary
- Only then propose strategy changes

---

## 8.4. IMAGE ATTRIBUTES VERIFICATION

### All Images Require:
- **Width attribute** - Must match actual image dimensions (verify with file check, not assumptions)
- **Height attribute** - Must match actual image dimensions (verify with file check, not assumptions)
- **Alt text** - Descriptive text for accessibility and SEO
- **Loading attribute** - Add `loading="lazy"` for performance optimization

### Verification Process
- **DO NOT ASSUME** image dimensions - always verify actual file dimensions
- Use file command or image inspection tools to confirm width x height
- Common dimensions on this site: 800x533, 800x600, 400x200, etc.
- Incorrect dimensions cause:
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) - harms Core Web Vitals and SEO
  - Browser reflows and performance issues
  - Poor user experience with layout jumping

### Example - CORRECT:
```html
<img class='margin-tb-25' src="/images/example.webp" alt="Description" width="800" height="533" loading="lazy">
```

### Example - INCORRECT:
```html
<!-- Missing width and height -->
<img class='margin-tb-25' src="/images/example.webp" alt="Description">
<!-- Wrong dimensions assumed without verification -->
<img class='margin-tb-25' src="/images/example.webp" alt="Description" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy">
```

## 8.5. HERO SECTION LAYOUT & STRUCTURE

### Hero Section Pattern
- Use the `outer-flex` responsive layout pattern for hero sections on all pages
- Location: Reference the `template.html` file for the exact structure

### Implementation
- **Parent container:** `<section class="margin-tb-25">`
- **Main wrapper:** `<div class="padding-15 outer-flex">`
- **Image:** `<img class="max-width-90p-h-auto margin-rl30" width="800" height="533" src="..." alt="...">`
- **Content wrapper:** `<div class='centerSmall'>`
  - Include H1 inside centerSmall div
  - Include "What You'll Learn" section inside centerSmall div
  - Include call-to-action paragraph inside centerSmall div

### Benefits
- Responsive design that adapts to mobile and desktop
- Image and text side-by-side on desktop
- Stacked on mobile with proper sizing
- Consistent styling across all pages

### Key CSS Classes
- `outer-flex`: Responsive flex container
- `centerSmall`: Text content wrapper
- `max-width-90p-h-auto`: Image sizing
- `margin-rl30`: Image margins (left/right)
- `stagger1`: H1 animation effect
- `balanced-text`: Text wrapping optimization

## 11. DO NOT DO

- Do NOT add brand names to meta descriptions

---

## 12. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### Questions vs. Action Intent
- **CRITICAL:** When user asks a question, provide an answer - do NOT assume they want you to take action
- Example WRONG: User asks "how do you know those images are 800x600?" → I immediately verify and fix without asking
- Example RIGHT: User asks "how do you know those images are 800x600?" → I explain I didn't verify, then ask "Would you like me to check and fix them?"
- **Only take action when explicitly instructed** - never assume from questions

### General Communication Guidelines
- Always propose before implementing large changes
- Ask questions when uncertain
- Reference specific lines/sections when discussing
- Summarize findings before proceeding
- Confirm user satisfaction before moving to next page
- Track progress transparently
- Answer questions directly before offering solutions
