## ‚ö†Ô∏è AREAS NEEDING ATTENTION

These keywords are showing up A LOT but getting no clicks:

| Keyword | Impressions | Position | Action Needed |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| blinds oklahoma city | 35 | 15.29 | Need page 1 (top 10) |
| custom blinds oklahoma city | 15 | 16.67 | Need page 1 |

| patio shades edmond ok | 10 | 17.4 | Need page 1 |
