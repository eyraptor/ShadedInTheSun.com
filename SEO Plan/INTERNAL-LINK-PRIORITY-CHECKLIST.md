## When Updating Related Articles Sections

**ALWAYS follow this process:**

1. **Read this checklist** before updating any Related Articles
2. **Check which priority pages** are NOT yet linked from the current page
3. **Prioritize adding links to (in order):**
   - 2025Trends.html (if not already linked)
   - best-window-treatments-oklahoma-weather.html (if not already linked)
   - why-is-hunter-douglas-so-expensive.html (if not already linked)
   - Top-Five-Window-Treatment-Trends-in-Oklahoma-City.html (if not already linked)
4. **Avoid duplicating** links that are already in the main page content
5. **Ensure all 3 Related Articles links** go to pages that genuinely complement the current page's topic
