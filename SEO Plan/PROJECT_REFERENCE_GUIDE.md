## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE!)

### ALWAYS Check These Before Making Recommendations:

1. **Read the Master Plan FIRST**
   - File: `/mnt/project/10-17-2025_-_MASTER-UNIFIED-SEO-PLAN-v2-FINAL.md`
   - Never recommend something that contradicts the plan
   - Check which week of the plan we're in

2. **Verify Current Website Status**
   - Don't assume pages haven't been updated
   - Ask user for current status if uncertain
   - Check actual live pages when possible

3. **Protect What's Working**
   - Solar shades page (position 3.4) - DO NOT TOUCH
   - Zebra shades page (position 3.1) - DO NOT TOUCH
   - Nichols Hills page (position 2.9) - DO NOT TOUCH
   - Any page on page 1 positions 1-5 - PROTECT FIERCELY

4. **Focus on Page 2 Keywords (Positions 11-20)**
   - These are closest to page 1
   - Highest ROI for optimization effort
   - Don't worry about page 5 keywords yet

5. **Wait 3-4 Weeks Between Major Changes**
   - Google needs time to re-index
   - Volatility is normal after updates
   - Document dates of changes

## 🔗 ANCHOR ID REFERENCE (Internal Linking Guide)

**Purpose:** Track all page anchor IDs and their use cases. Use this when writing content that should link to specific sections within pages.

### How to Use This Section:
1. **When writing/editing content:** Check this list to see if there's a relevant anchor to link to
2. **Link only when relevant:** Match the article topic to the anchor's content description and keywords
3. **Add new IDs here first:** When adding a new anchor ID to a page, document it in this section
4. **Format for entries:**
   - **Page name** | **ID** | **Section title** | **Content description** | **Linking keywords** | **Notes**

### Current Anchor IDs:

| Page | ID | Section | Content | Link Keywords | Notes |
|------|----|---------|---------|----|-------|
| fiveCustomBlindReasons.html | why-custom-blinds | Main section | Overview comparing custom vs ready-made blinds | custom blinds, comparison, ready-made alternatives | Safe link - general intro to page topic |

### Instructions for Adding New Anchor IDs:

When you add a new anchor ID to any page:
1. **Add the ID to the HTML** (e.g., `<h2 id="section-name">`)
2. **Immediately update this table** with: page name, ID, section title, content description, relevant keywords, and any usage notes
3. **Be specific about content** - don't just say "installation," specify if it's motorized-only, professional-only, etc.
4. **Include usage context** - what articles or scenarios would benefit from linking to this section

## 📚 COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: Why don't we create new pages for all the keywords?**
A: Master Plan says optimize EXISTING pages first. New pages take 3-6 months to rank. Better ROI optimizing page 2 keywords.

**Q: Why not optimize the solar shades page further?**
A: It's at position 3.4 (top of page 1). Any changes risk making it worse. PROTECT what's working!

**Q: User says a page hasn't been optimized but the plan says it should be done.**
A: ASK the user for current status. Don't assume. They may have done it, or they may need the exact steps.

**Q: How long should we wait to see results?**
A: 2-3 weeks for Google to re-index. 4-6 weeks for position stabilization. Document change dates!

**Q: What if user wants to do something NOT in the Master Plan?**
A: Read the plan's reasoning first. If their idea is good, acknowledge it but explain the plan's logic. Suggest documenting as "deviation from plan" so we can track results.
