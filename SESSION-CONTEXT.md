## REFERENCE DOCUMENTS LOCATION
These files are on branch `claude/improve-link-descriptions-seo-011CUkzktfj3FBQFbB5THtkz`:

1. **10-17-2025 - MASTER-UNIFIED-SEO-PLAN-v2-FINAL.md** - Master keyword strategy (100 keywords across 7 tiers)
2. **10-17-2025 - seo_performance_analysis.md** - Performance metrics showing 6X click improvement
3. **WriteSonic/10-31-25 Report/seo-audit-report-shadedinthesun.com-2025-11-01.xlsx** - Most recent audit (Excel file)

## SEO FIXES PATTERN (FROM COMPLETED FILES)

### 1. Title Tag Optimization
- **Shorten titles** to stay under 60 characters
- **Example:** "Custom Window Shades Oklahoma City & Edmond | Norman® Roller Shades, Cellular Shades" → "Norman Window Shades OKC | Roller & Cellular Shades"
- Keep location keywords (OKC, Edmond) but be concise

### 2. Meta Description Optimization
- **Keep under 160 characters** for optimal SEO
- Include primary keywords and location
- Must be compelling for click-through

### 3. Fix Non-Descriptive Links
Replace ALL instances of generic link text:
- **NEVER:** "Read More →", "Click Here", "Learn More"
- **ALWAYS:** Descriptive text that tells what the link leads to
- **Examples from completed files:**
  - "Read More →" → "Understanding shade openness factors"
  - "Read More →" → "Explore motorized installation services"
  - "Read More →" → "View latest window treatment trends"

### 4. Remove Plantation Shutters References
- Remove from schema markup `itemListElement`
- Site doesn't sell plantation shutters - causes SEO confusion
- **Example:** Delete line `{"@type": "Offer", "itemOffered": {"@type": "Service", "name": "Plantation Shutters"}},`

### 5. Add Norman Product References
- **CRITICAL:** Site is light on Norman content (new dealer)
- When editing text for readability, look for opportunities to mention Norman products
- Reference Norman product lines: Soluna™ Roller Shades, Portrait™ Cellular Shades, SmartDrape™
- Add links to /norman.html and /norman-smartdrape-oklahoma-city.html where natural

### 6. Add Internal Links
- Naturally integrate links to other relevant pages
- Link to /graber.html for Graber products
- Link to /norman.html for Norman products
- Link to /window-shades.html, /window-shutters.html as relevant
- Link to /motorized-window-treatments-for-OKC.html when discussing automation
- **Must feel natural in the text** - don't force it

### 7. Verify Product Accuracy
Cross-reference ALL product claims against manufacturer sites:
- **Graber products:** Check graberblinds.com
- **Norman products:** Check normanusa.com
- Ensure product names, features, and specifications are accurate
