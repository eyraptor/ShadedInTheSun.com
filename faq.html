          <div class='margin-rl-20'>
            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>How much do custom window treatments cost?</h3>
            <p>Our custom window treatments start at different price points depending on your needs and choices. Custom blinds start at $140 per window, Custom Cellular Shades start at $150 per window, and Custom Roller Shades start at $215 per window. These are product-only prices, with professional installation calculated separately based on the number of windows, complexity, and your specific requirements. Every project and quote includes free in-home consultation, precise measurement, professional installation, manufacturer warranty coverage, and detailed written estimates with no hidden fees.</p>
  
            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>Do you offer free consultations?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Every project begins with a complimentary in-home consultation that includes professional measurement of all windows to be installed, design consultation based on your style and needs, material samples you can keep, detailed written estimate, and timeline and installation scheduling. Consultations typically take 60-90 minutes and are available evenings and weekends. No pressure, no obligation - just expert advice to help you make the best decision for your home.</p>
  
            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>Are there any hidden fees or additional costs?</h3>
            <p>No hidden fees ever. Our written estimates include everything: consultation, measurement, custom manufacturing, professional installation, operation training, and manufacturer warranty coverage. The price we quote is the price you pay. We believe in transparent, honest pricing so you can make informed decisions about your investment.</p>

          <h2 class='h-center balanced-text variable-h2'>Installation Process</h2>
  
          <div class='margin-rl-20 h-center-div '>
            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>How long does installation take?</h3>
            <p>Most installations are completed in 2-4 hours depending on the project size. A single room with 3-5 windows typically takes 2-3 hours. A whole home with 15-20 windows requires a full day installation. Complex motorization adds an additional 1-2 hours for programming and training. We schedule installations at your convenience, including evenings and weekends. Our team arrives on time, works efficiently, and cleans up completely before leaving.</p>
  
            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>Who does the installation work?</h3>
            <p>Our professional installation team includes trained installers plus hands-on involvement from Brent and Edna themselves. Every motorized system is precisely installed, thoroughly tested, and includes comprehensive operation training. We handle smart home integration setup during installation and provide ongoing support for any questions. The complete service approach means you work with one trusted company throughout the entire process.</p>
  
            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>What should I expect during installation day?</h3>
            <p>Our installation team will arrive at the scheduled time with all necessary tools and materials. We'll protect your floors and furniture, install your window treatments with precision, test all operations, provide comprehensive training on use and care, clean up completely, and be available for any questions. We ask you to have the area around each of the windows to have window treatements installed cleared so we have access to the window. Most customers are amazed at how quickly and cleanly we complete the installation.</p>

          <h2 class='h-center balanced-text variable-h2'>Products & Brands</h2>
  
          <div class='h-center-div  margin-rl-20'>
            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>What brands do you carry?</h3>
            <p>We are authorized dealers for Graber, Draper, and Norman, three of the industry's leading manufacturers. Graber offers an extensive selection of blinds, shades, shutters, and drapery with their exclusive UltraLite Cordless technology and Limited Lifetime Warranty. Draper is an American company that specializes in custom solar control solutions, FlexShade systems and the Draper@Home range of products, manufactured in Indiana since 1902 with expertise in energy-efficient window treatments and custom design-build capabilities for unique architectural challenges. Norman provides a full range of window tratments and they specialize in premium wood shutters and blinds known for their craftsmanship and durability. All three brands represent the highest quality materials and manufacturing available, ensuring you get window treatments built to last in Oklahoma's challenging climate.</p>
  
            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>What's the difference between blinds and shades?</h3>
            <p>Blinds have individual slats that can be tilted to control light and privacy, offering precise light control. They're available in wood, faux wood, and aluminum materials. Shades are made of continuous fabric that raises and lowers, available in various styles including cellular, roller, Roman, and solar shades. Shades typically offer better insulation and softer light filtering, while blinds provide more precise light control and durability.</p>
  
            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>Do you install window treatments from other companies?</h3>
            <p>We specialize in selling and installing our own high-quality Graber, Norman and Draper products to ensure complete quality control and warranty support. This approach allows us to provide seamless service from consultation through installation and ongoing support. When you choose Shaded In The Sun, you get the expertise of the same company that selected, measured, and installed your treatments.</p>

            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>Can you motorize existing window treatments?</h3>
            <p>To deliver the highest quality and reliability, we specialize in new window treatments that are specifically designed and manufactured for motorized operation from the ground up. This approach ensures optimal performance, longevity, and warranty coverage. Motorized window treatments require precise engineering - from the mounting systems to the fabric weights to the motor integration - that's best achieved during the initial manufacturing process. When you choose new motorized treatments from Shaded In The Sun, you get systems designed to work flawlessly together with full manufacturer support and warranty protection.</p>
  
            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>Do motorized treatments work with smart home systems?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely! Our motorized window treatments integrate with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple, and Siri. We include basic smart home setup in every motorized installation and provide training on voice commands and app control. You can control individual windows or entire rooms with simple voice commands or smartphone apps.</p>
  
            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>What's special about Graber's UltraLite system?</h3>
            <p>Graber's UltraLite Cordless system is the quietest, smoothest motorized operation available. It requires only the lightest touch and operates so quietly it won't wake a sleeping baby. The precision positioning allows you to place shades exactly where you want them every time. Available on solar shades, roller shades, and layered shades, it's the ultimate cordless experience that must be felt to be believed.</p>

          <div class='margin-rl-20 h-center-div'>
            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>What warranty do you provide?</h3>
            <p>Your window treatments are backed by comprehensive manufacturer warranties from Graber, Norman and Draper, typically ranging
            from 1-5 years depending on the specific product. As your authorized dealer, we handle all warranty coordination and support on your behalf. Beyond the manufacturer coverage, we provide ongoing service and support for the lifetime of your treatments - including operation guidance, care instructions, minor adjustments, and assistance with any warranty claims. If issues arise, you have a local partner who knows your installation and will work directly with the manufacturer to resolve any problems quickly.</p>
  
            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>How do I care for my window treatments?</h3>
            <p>Maintenance is simple and we provide care instructions for every product. Blinds need regular dusting with microfiber cloth or vacuum brush attachment. Shades require light vacuuming or professional cleaning for delicate fabrics. Shutters need damp cloth cleaning and occasional wood conditioning for hardwood. Motorized treatments need battery charging reminders and system updates.</p>
  
            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>What if I need repairs or adjustments?</h3>
            <p>As your local window treatment specialists, we're here to support you throughout the life of your treatments. We provide guidance on operation questions, care and maintenance instructions, assistance with manufacturer warranty claims when needed, and recommendations for professional cleaning services. For any issues covered under manufacturer warranty, we coordinate directly with Graber, Draper, or Norman to ensure quick resolution. For adjustments due to settling or seasonal changes, we can assess what's needed and provide solutions. Our ongoing relationship means you have knowledgeable local experts who understand your specific installation and can help you maintain optimal performance from your investment.</p>

            <h3 class='variable-h3-orange'>Do you remove and reinstall window treatments for home renovations</h3>
            <p>Yes, we offer removal and reinstallation services for window treatments we originally installed. Whether you're replacing windows, painting, doing construction work, or making other home improvements around your windows, we can carefully remove your treatments beforehand and reinstall them once your project is complete. This service helps protect your investment during renovations and ensures proper reinstallation by the team that knows your specific treatments and installation. Contact us in advance of your project so we can coordinate timing and provide you with a quote for the removal and reinstallation service.</p>
