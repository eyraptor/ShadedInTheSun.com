## 🚀 HOW TO RESUME WORK (COPY THIS PROMPT)

**Paste this EXACT prompt in new sessions:**
```
I'm working on SEO optimization for ShadedInTheSun.com.

ZEROTH: Switch to Haiku model (/model haiku) - This pattern-based SEO work runs perfectly on Haiku 4.5 at 90% of Sonnet performance but 3x more token-efficient, making sessions last much longer
FIRST: Switch to branch claude/resume-prompt-issue-011CUmqgzUpwwmTSeeHujoJs
SECOND: Read the file at /home/user/ShadedInTheSun.com/SESSION-CONTEXT-FULL.md
THIRD: Continue SEO work on the next batch of 5 files from the "NEXT BATCH TO COMPLETE" section
FOURTH: Follow all patterns in "SEO FIXES PATTERN" section and use keywords from "MASTER KEYWORD LIST"
FIFTH: Commit and push when done

The SESSION-CONTEXT-FULL.md file contains everything you need (83 keywords, products, patterns, etc.)

**IMPORTANT:** The work on current branch (Batches 1 & 2) may be duplicating work already done on other branches. Need to merge or verify what's still needed.

## SEO FIXES PATTERN (FROM COMPLETED FILES)

### 1. Title Tag Optimization
- **Shorten titles** to stay under 60 characters
- **Example:** "Custom Window Shades Oklahoma City & Edmond | Norman® Roller Shades, Cellular Shades" → "Norman Window Shades OKC | Roller & Cellular Shades"
- Keep location keywords (OKC, Edmond) but be concise

### 2. Meta Description Optimization
- **Keep under 160 characters** for optimal SEO
- Include primary keywords and location
- Must be compelling for click-through

### 3. Fix Non-Descriptive Links
Replace ALL instances of generic link text:
- **NEVER:** "Read More →", "Click Here", "Learn More"
- **ALWAYS:** Descriptive text that tells what the link leads to
- **Examples from completed files:**
  - "Read More →" → "Understanding shade openness factors"
  - "Read More →" → "Explore motorized installation services"
  - "Read More →" → "View latest window treatment trends"

### 4. Plantation Shutters - DO NOT ADD MORE
- **CRITICAL:** Site DOES sell plantation shutters but doesn't push them
- **DO NOT add new plantation shutter content or pages**
- **DO NOT remove existing plantation shutter references** (they're fine)
- Previous removal work was done when they weren't selling them at all
- Keep what's there, just don't expand on it

### 5. Add Norman Product References
- **CRITICAL:** Site is light on Norman content (new dealer)
- When editing text for readability, look for opportunities to mention Norman products
- Reference Norman product lines: Soluna™ Roller Shades, Portrait™ Cellular Shades, SmartDrape™
- Add links to /norman.html and /norman-smartdrape-oklahoma-city.html where natural

### 6. Add Internal Links
- Naturally integrate links to other relevant pages
- Link to /graber.html for Graber products
- Link to /norman.html for Norman products
- Link to /window-shades.html, /window-shutters.html as relevant
- Link to /motorized-window-treatments-for-OKC.html when discussing automation
- **Must feel natural in the text** - don't force it

### 7. Verify Product Accuracy
Cross-reference ALL product claims against manufacturer sites:
- **Graber products:** Check graberblinds.com
- **Norman products:** Check normanusa.com
- Ensure product names, features, and specifications are accurate
