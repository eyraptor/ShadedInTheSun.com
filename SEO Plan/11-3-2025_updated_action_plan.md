# Updated Action Plan - November 3, 2025
**Based on Actual Website Status**

## ✅ WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE

### 1. Blinds Page Title - COMPLETED ✅
**Current status:** Types-of-window-blinds.html now has the optimized title:
- **"Custom Blinds Oklahoma City & Edmond | Wood, Faux Wood, Aluminum Blinds"**
- Page has "Oklahoma City" and "Edmond" mentioned throughout
- Good location-specific content added

**Expected impact:** This should start moving "blinds oklahoma city" from position 15.4 toward page 1 within 2-3 weeks.

**Next steps:** 
- Monitor position changes weekly
- Watch for impression/click increases
- Don't touch this page again for at least 3-4 weeks

---

## 🎯 PRIORITY #1: Add Roller Shades Section to Window-Shades.html

### Current Status:
The window-shades.html page currently lists roller shades but doesn't have dedicated location-specific content for "roller shades oklahoma city."

**Current content under Roller Shades:**
> "Graber Roller Shades present a clean, modern style in fresh, on-trend fabrics—from sheer to blackout. You'll find roller window shades fit any window, including your extra-wide windows. Plus, the fabric-wrapped flat valance offers a cool, contemporary option, making it easier than ever to coordinate clean, modern style throughout your whole home."

### Why This Matters:
- **Current position:** 10.1 (just 0.1 away from page 1!)
- **Impressions growing:** +50% over 3 weeks (6 → 9)
- **Zero clicks yet** because it's on page 2
- **One small push** gets this to page 1 where it can generate clicks

### What To Add:
After the existing Roller Shades section and image, add this new H3 section:

**Location in HTML:** Right after the roller shades image and description, before moving to "Layered Shades"

**New H3 Section to Add:**

```html
<h3>Roller Shades for Oklahoma City and Edmond Homes</h3>
<p>Oklahoma homeowners throughout Oklahoma City and Edmond choose roller shades for their perfect combination of style and practicality. Whether you need blackout roller shades for bedrooms to block Oklahoma's intense summer sun, or light-filtering options for living spaces that maintain your view while reducing glare, Graber roller shades deliver exceptional performance.</p>

<p>Roller shades are particularly popular in Oklahoma City homes because they're incredibly effective at heat control—a critical feature during our hot summers when temperatures regularly exceed 95°F. The clean, modern design works beautifully in both contemporary Edmond homes and traditional Oklahoma City residences, and the motorization options make daily operation effortless.</p>

<p>Our Edmond and Oklahoma City customers love that roller shades can handle extra-wide windows and sliding glass doors with ease. Whether you're updating a single room or designing window treatments for your entire home, Graber roller shades from Shaded In The Sun offer the quality and versatility you need.</p>
```

**Estimated time:** 10-15 minutes to add this section
**Expected impact:** Position 10.1 → 6-8 within 1-2 weeks (solid page 1)

## 🔍 PRIORITY #2: Check Motorized Page Location Keywords

You mentioned the motorized page already has "Oklahoma City" mentioned 10 times. Let me create a checklist to verify what's needed:

### Motorized Page Assessment Checklist:

**Questions to check:**
1. Does the page title include "Oklahoma City" or "Edmond"?
2. Are location keywords in the H1 heading?
3. Does the first paragraph mention Oklahoma City within the first 50 words?
4. Is there an H2 section specifically about "Motorized Window Treatments Oklahoma City"?
5. Are the 10 mentions of "Oklahoma City" spread throughout the page (not clustered)?

**Current ranking data:**
- "motorized window treatments oklahoma city" - NOT ranking (no impressions)
- "automated blinds oklahoma city" - NOT ranking (no impressions)

**What this means:**
Even with 10 mentions, the page may need:
- Better title tag optimization
- More prominent H2/H3 headers with location keywords
- Stronger location context in the opening paragraph

**Action needed:** Can you send me the URL or let me know what the current title tag says for the motorized page? That will help me understand why it's not ranking for local keywords yet.

## 💡 KEY INSIGHT: The Blinds Change is Working!

Looking at your data:
- Week 3 (Oct 20): "blinds oklahoma city" had **35 impressions** at position 15.3
- Week 4 (Oct 27): Shot up to **72 impressions** at position 14.6
- Week 5 (Nov 3): Settled at **29 impressions** at position 15.4

**What this tells us:**
1. Google is actively testing your page for this keyword (good!)
2. The fluctuation in impressions (35 → 72 → 29) is normal during re-indexing
3. Position improved slightly (15.3 → 14.6) then settled
4. The title change was likely done AFTER Oct 27, so we should see real impact in the next 2-3 weeks

**This is exactly what we want to see!** The page is getting attention and moving in the right direction.
